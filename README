smartid : Remote Uwatec Smart Protocol Daemon
---------------------------------------------

Author: Jonathan Krauss
E-Mail: jkrauss <at> asymworks <dot> com

The SmartI Daemon provides a method to transfer data from a Uwatec Smart device
across a network, using an IrDA adapter local to the machine where the daemon
runs.  Its primary target is to run on a Raspberry Pi and transfer data to a
Mac OS X Mavericks machine, which does not have IrDA support.
