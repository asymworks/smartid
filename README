smartid : Remote Uwatec Smart Protocol Daemon
---------------------------------------------

The SmartI Daemon provides a method to transfer data from a Uwatec Smart device
across a network, using an IrDA adapter local to the machine where the daemon
runs.  Its primary target is to run on a Raspberry Pi and transfer data to a
Mac OS X Mavericks machine, which does not have IrDA support.

The daemon is confirmed to work on a Raspberry Pi Model B running Raspbian and
kernel version 3.12, and communicating with a Uwatec Aladin Tec 2G.  Other 
platforms and Smart devices have not been evaluated.
